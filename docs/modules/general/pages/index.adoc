== Introduction
// TODO: Add ref to developer docs
This documentation aims to explain the technical details of the OneCX architecture. It is **NOT** a guide on how to develop applications using OneCX. For such resources, please refer to TODO. Instead, it will focus on providing in-depth information on how our solution enables to:

* create applications with easily replacable components and
