This chapter gives an overview of the fundamental architecture of OneCX. 

*Core Architecture Principles*

* *Microservices- and microfrontend-based architecture*: The platform is composed of independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
* *Backend for frontend (BFF)*: OneCX proposes and uses the backend for frontend pattern for communication between frontend and backend.
* *API-first design*: RESTful APIs are used for communication between the frontend and backend, as well as between microservices.
* *Containerization and CI/CD*: Services are containerized using Docker, and the project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
* *Cloud-native architecture*: Services are designed to be deployed in cloud environments with Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring easy scaling and high availability.

[#applications]
== Applications
To reduce testing and deployment complexity OneCX uses a concept called _application_. An _application_ is a versioned bundle of frontends, BFFs, backends. The parts of an _application_ are called _apps_. An _application_ contains all system parts of a specific subdomain (e.g. user management). The testing and deployment are always done for a complete _application_. This reduces the effort because it reduces the possible permutations which must be considered. 

[#workspaces]
== Workspaces
In OneCX a workspace is a set of settings for a portal for a subset of the users or for a special purpose, e.g. there could be a workspace focusing on administrating the system or one focusing on sales. The number of workspaces in the system is not limited. 

A workspace contains the following settings: 

* Name 
* Path to identify the workspace from the URL 
* Theme 
* Menu 
* List of selected applications from the pool of available applications with 
** Path inside the workspace 
** {frontend_shell_url}[Slot configuration]
