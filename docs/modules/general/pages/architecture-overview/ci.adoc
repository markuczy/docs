The project employs GitHub Actions to automate various stages of their software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying applications. This workflow is triggered on specific events, such as pushes to the main branch or pull requests, and is responsible for compiling the application's code, running tests, and preparing artifacts for deployment. The workflow's configuration specifies the sequence of steps to be executed, ensuring consistency and reliability in the build process. 

The use of GitHub Actions across the OneCX organization streamlines development processes, enhances collaboration among team members, and maintains high-quality standards throughout the software development lifecycle.
